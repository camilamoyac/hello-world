# Overview

As a developing software engineer, my goal is to strengthen my foundation in programming and web development. This project is a simple example of creating an interactive web page using core technologies like HTML and JavaScript. It demonstrates my ability to build, organize, and deliver functional code that meets defined requirements.

Hello Name is a simple web page that lets users enter their name and receive a personalized greeting. It uses basic HTML and JavaScript to demonstrate dynamic interaction in the browser: updating the page content in response to user input without requiring a page refresh.

This small project was created to practice foundational web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and clean code organization. It serves as a minimal yet functional example of how JavaScript can make a static web page interactive.

This is my video demo:

# Development Environment

Tools Used

The project was developed using Visual Studio Code for coding, Google Chrome for testing, and the Live Server extension for quick previews. Git and GitHub were used for version control.

Programming Language

The web app is built with JavaScript (ES6) to handle user interaction and update the page dynamically. HTML provides the page structure.
